Ladies and gentlemen,

Today, I'm thrilled to showcase to you our latest innovation: the Real-Time Feed Dashboard. This dashboard represents a significant step forward in how we monitor and manage our feeds, bringing transparency, collaboration, and efficiency to the forefront of our operations.

At its core, the Real-Time Feed Dashboard provides us with instant insights into the status and progress of our feeds. Through intuitive categorization and live updates, we can easily identify feeds that require attention and take proactive measures to ensure their success.

One of the standout features of this dashboard is its ability to provide a detailed view of each feed, including its steps and logs. This level of granularity empowers us to pinpoint issues quickly, streamline troubleshooting, and accelerate resolution times.

Furthermore, the inclusion of an interactive forum within the dashboard fosters collaboration among team members. Here, questions can be raised, insights shared, and discussions facilitatedâ€”all in real-time. Our AD team and prod support team are actively engaged in this forum, providing timely assistance and guidance whenever needed.

To ensure that critical discussions are not missed, we've implemented a notification system that alerts relevant teams via email whenever a new comment is posted. This promotes responsiveness and ensures that issues are addressed promptly.

Finally, the dashboard boasts a powerful search functionality, enabling users to effortlessly retrieve information from within the feed descriptions and comments. This not only saves time but also facilitates knowledge sharing and documentation.

In conclusion, our Real-Time Feed Dashboard is more than just a tool; it's a game-changer. It empowers us to make data-driven decisions, fosters collaboration, and drives efficiency across our operations. I invite you to explore the dashboard firsthand and witness the transformative impact it can have on our workflow.

Thank you for your attention. Let's embark on this journey of innovation together.

Introducing Our Real-Time Feed Dashboard

[Slide 2: Overview]

Welcome everyone, today I'm thrilled to present to you our latest innovation: the Real-Time Feed Dashboard.
This dashboard provides a comprehensive view of all our feeds, their statuses, and their progress in real-time.
It's designed to enhance transparency, streamline communication, and empower our teams to make data-driven decisions.
[Slide 3: Dashboard Overview]

Here's a glimpse of our dashboard. As you can see, it's divided into three categories, each showcasing the status of feeds: Not Started, Completed, In Progress, and Failed.
The live progress of each feed is displayed, giving us instant insights into their performance.
By default, the dashboard shows feeds for today, but we can easily navigate to view historical data as well.
[Slide 4: Detailed Feed View]

Clicking on a feed provides a detailed view, including its steps and logs. This level of granularity allows us to pinpoint issues quickly and take necessary actions.
Additionally, we've incorporated a forum button for each feed. Clicking on it reveals a drawer on the right-hand side.
[Slide 5: Forum Functionality]

The drawer showcases the feed's description and rules, ensuring everyone is aligned with its objectives.
More importantly, it features a comment section where team members can raise questions or provide insights.
Our AD team and prod support team are actively engaged here, responding promptly to inquiries and providing assistance as needed.
[Slide 6: Notification System]

We've implemented a notification system that alerts relevant teams via email whenever a new comment is posted.
This ensures that critical discussions are not missed, promoting collaboration and problem-solving in real-time.
[Slide 7: Search Functionality]

The dashboard also boasts a powerful search feature within the forum block.
Users can search for specific keywords or topics within the feed description and comments, making information retrieval effortless.
[Slide 8: Benefits]

Let's recap the benefits of our Real-Time Feed Dashboard:
Enhanced visibility and transparency.
Improved communication and collaboration.
Rapid issue identification and resolution.
Efficient knowledge sharing and documentation.
Empowerment through data-driven decision-making.
[Slide 9: Conclusion]

In conclusion, our Real-Time Feed Dashboard is not just a tool; it's a catalyst for driving efficiency and excellence in our operations.
With its intuitive interface, powerful features, and real-time capabilities, it's poised to revolutionize how we manage and monitor our feeds.
I invite you to explore the dashboard firsthand and experience the transformative impact it can have on our workflow.
Thank you for your attention.
[Slide 10: Q&A]

Now, I'm open to any questions or feedback you may have. Let's dive into a discussion about our Real-Time Feed Dashboard.




In our dashboard, we have two distinct blocks. The top block serves as the status counter, offering a quick glance at the count of package statuses for each of our systems. 

As part of the billing team, we heavily rely on feed data originating from various upstream sources. These feeds contain crucial information integral to our processes. To streamline our operations, we've segmented our workflow into three systems: Infomine, Billing, and VH. Consequently, we manage packages across three separate websites. 

Within this block, you'll find five boxes, each representing a different status type, along with its corresponding count. This allows users to not only see the individual status counts for each system but also the aggregated counts within each box.

This real-time dashboard is particularly beneficial for our production support team. By simply referring to this dashboard, they can effortlessly track today's package executions, identifying how many packages have failed, which ones are currently running, and more. This immediate access to status updates enables prompt action on any failures, ultimately reducing operational noise and enhancing efficiency. Moreover, users need not manually refresh the page for the latest updates, as the dashboard automatically updates as soon as new data is available in the database.

To achieve this real-time functionality, we've leveraged Socket.IO technology. This enables seamless communication between the server and clients, ensuring that updates are propagated to the dashboard instantly upon data changes.

Now, let's delve into the bottom block, where Afrin will provide an overview of the detailed package view. Afrin, over to you.
